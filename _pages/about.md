Hi, my name is Trung Vu. I now work at [LinkedIn Corporation](https://linkedin.com). I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/), [University of Maryland, Baltimore County](https://umbc.edu/), working with [Dr. TÃ¼lay Adali](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~adali/). I completed my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/) at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), advised by [Dr. Raviv Raich](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~raich/). My research focuses on optimization theory, matrix analysis, independent component analysis, and machine learning for signal processing.
