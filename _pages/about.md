I am a 3nd year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/) - AI/Machine Learning group - at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), advised by [Dr. Raviv Raich](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~raich/). I received my B.S. in Computer Science at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, in Talented Engineer's Program . During my undergraduate, I had chance to work on several AI projects including fuzzy logic, text summarization, and threat evaluation. Those experiences equipped me with research skills and mathematic background, and more importantly, inspired me to apply for a PhD program in Machine Learning. 


Research Interest
======
My research focuses on Statistical Machine Learning and Optimization Methods. I am interested in applying optimization techniques to improve performance of machine learning algorithms as well as understanding their convergence properties. Recently, I am studying the theory of random matrices and trying to make some connections to the low-rank matrix completion problem.

I am also passionate about real-world applications of Machine Learning. Starting from Winter 2016, I joined a 2-year commercialization project with [SmartVineyards](http://smartvineyards.net/) in developing an intelligent decision support system to improve irrigation management in vineyards and other west coast crops. This project brings together researchers from different departments at Oregon State University and Washington State University.
