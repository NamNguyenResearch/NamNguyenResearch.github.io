Hi, my name is Trung Vu. I am a third year Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/) - AI / Machine Learning group - at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), advised by [Dr. Raviv Raich](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~raich/). My research focuses on scalable optimization methods in machine learning and signal processing. I am passionate about the challenging problems that arise in the core of optimization methods such as the convergence properties and accommodation of acceleration. 



> ## News and Updates
* 2019
	* **02/26**: We just found a wonderful solution to one of our research problem on the asymptotic convergence of first-order optimization methods. It has been taking us almost two months!
	* **02/15**: I am fortunate to receive the IEEE Signal Processing Society Travel Grant for ICASSP 2019. See you, London!
	* **02/01**: Our two papers "Accelerating Iterative Hard Thresholding for Low-Rank Matrix Completion via Adaptive Restart" and "Local Convergence of the Heavy Ball method in Iterative Hard Thresholding for Low-Rank Matrix Completion" were accepted to ICASSP 2019!
* 2018
	* **12/30**: The 2-year project with SmartVineyards has ended. I have learnt a lot from this project! Looking forward to the outcome of our proposals along this line of work.
	* **11/19**: I passed the PhD Qualifying Exam and now is a PhD candidate. So excited about the PhD life ahead!
	* **03/27**: Our paper "Adaptive Step Size Momentum Method for Deconvolution" was accepted to SSP 2018. This is my **first** paper got accepted during my PhD at OSU! 
	* **02/15**: PhD Program Meeting. 3 more courses to go...
* 2017
	* **01/09**: Starting from Winter 2017, I joined a 2-year commercialization project with [SmartVineyards](http://smartvineyards.net/) in developing an intelligent decision support system to improve irrigation management in vineyards and other west coast crops. This project is funded by [Oregon BEST](https://oregonbest.org) and brings together researchers from different departments at Oregon State University and Washington State University. I am the only graduate student in the group.
