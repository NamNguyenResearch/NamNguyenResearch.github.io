# About me

I received the B.Eng. degree (Hons.) in Electronics and Communications Engineering from [Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology](https://english.ptit.edu.vn/), Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2021; and the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) in wireless communication from [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), United States, in 2024. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/EECS), advised by [Prof. Thinh Nguyen](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~thinhq). My research focuses on information theory, machine learning, rate-distortion-perception representation for lossy compression, deep learning algorithms for classification-enhanced neural image compression, and wireless communication. 

For more details, please refer to [Publications](https://namnguyenresearch.github.io/publications) and [CV](https://namnguyenresearch.github.io/cv). If you are recruiting and are interested in my profile, feel free to send me an email at [nguynam4@oregonstate.edu]().
