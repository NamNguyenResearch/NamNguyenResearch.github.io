Hi, my name is Trung Vu. I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/) - AI / Machine Learning group - at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), advised by [Dr. Raviv Raich](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~raich/). My research primarily focuses on optimization theory, matrix analysis, and machine learning for signal processing. I have recently been interested in perturbation theory, random matrix theory, and differential geometry. <span style='color: red'>As I am graduating this Summer 2022, I am looking for a postdoc position</span> with a focus on theoretical analysis of optimization methods for machine learning.
