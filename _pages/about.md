Hi, my name is Nam Nguyen. I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/EECS), advised by [Prof. Thinh Nguyen](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~thinhq). My research focuses on information theory, machine learning, perceptual lossy compression, deep learning algorithms for classification-enhanced neural image compression, and wireless communication.
